            <p id="ptag">A healthy diet is essential for good health and nutrition. It protects you against many chronic
                noncommunicable diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes and cancer. Eating a variety of foods and
                consuming less salt, sugars and saturated and industrially-produced trans-fats, are essential for
                healthy diet.</p>

            <h1>HOW TO MAINTAIN A BALANCE DIET</h1>
            <p class="pg">A balanced diet is a diet that contains differing kinds of foods in certain quantities and
                proportions so that the requirement for calories, proteins, minerals, vitamins and alternative nutrients
                is adequate and a small provision is reserved for additional nutrients to endure the short length of
                leanness. In addition, a balanced diet ought to offer bioactive phytochemicals like dietary fiber,
                antioxidants and nutraceuticals that have positive health advantages. A balanced diet should offer
                around 60-70% of total calories from carbohydrates, 10-12% from proteins and 20-25% of total calories
                from fat.

                    Diet food refers to any food or beverage whose recipe is altered to reduce fat, carbohydrates,
                    and/or sugar in order to make it part of a weight loss program or diet. Such foods are usually
                    intended to assist in weight loss or a change in body type, although bodybuilding supplements are
                    designed to increase weight.

                    Vegetables are well-known for being good for your health. Most vegetables are low in calories but
                    high in vitamins, minerals and fiber.
                    However, some vegetables stand out from the rest with additional proven health benefits, such as the
                    ability to fight inflammation or reduce the risk of disease.
